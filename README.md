# SparePartAutoIdentification
Masters Project automatically identify valuable spare parts of used circuit boards 

Electronic circuit boards are frequently disposed of before they reach the end of their functional life. This represents large waste of critical raw materials and embodied energy. Meanwhile, spare parts inventories are expensive to maintain for companies who want to offer repairable products. This project will examine how auto-identification of components on used circuit boards could be employed to extract maximum value from used electronics. Specific valuable parts will be identified in-situ from a database of pre-existing information and prioritised for component de-soldering and removal.
